	<p class="journey">Ellie Bowen, Heather Drain, Amanda Wong, and Zahwa Hajyousif met at the 2015 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Microsoft and became fast friends. Their final project idea was inspired by lunchtime conversations about politics and their excitement (and anxiety) about being able to vote in their first election in 2016.Voteworthy.org is a result of their efforts to create a convenient and streamlined way to present comprehensive information about all the presidential candidates and put it in one, easily accessible place. </p>
